# Windows Configuration Scripts
My collection of Powershell and Batch scripts to automate and optimize Windows settings.

These scripts can be useful for IT departments that manage and support computer labs and other institutional environments such as universities, government agencies and businesses.

## Scripts list
| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `desativa_loginMS_hibernacao_faststartup.ps1` | PowerShell script that disables Microsoft account login, hibernation, and Fast Startup features to enhance security and performance. |
| `prevent_wallpaper_change.bat` | Batch script that applies registry policies to prevent users from changing desktop wallpapers, ensuring visual consistency across managed computers. |

## Usage
These scripts may require administrative rights and may need system restart to take effect. Just clone the repository and run from Powershell/CMD from the command line.
